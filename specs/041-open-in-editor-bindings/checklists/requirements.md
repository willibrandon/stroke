# Specification Quality Checklist: Open in Editor Bindings

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All items pass validation after clarification session corrections.
- Clarification session fixed 6 spec errors vs Python source: editor variable priority order, auto-accept after edit, read-only buffer guard, trailing newline stripping, editor exit code check, shell-split command parsing.
- The spec now faithfully reflects all observable behavior from `open_in_editor.py` and `buffer.py:open_in_editor()`.
- Ready for `/speckit.plan`.
