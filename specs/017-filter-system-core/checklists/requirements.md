# Specification Quality Checklist: Filter System (Core Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-01-26
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- All 18 functional requirements are clearly defined with testable criteria (expanded from 15 after API checklist review)
- 6 user stories cover all major use cases with prioritization (P1/P2/P3)
- 8 edge cases documented for boundary conditions (expanded from 5 after API checklist review)
- Thread safety requirement included per Constitution XI with quantified test criteria
- Zero external dependencies per Constitution III (Core layer)
- New Non-Functional Constraints section added for memory, visibility, operator precedence
- Python PTK source files explicitly referenced for verification
